# EU_CV_Easy_Styles
A CV template in the EU format (not Europass!), with predefined styles, for an easier filling.
This is the format usually required if you are applying as a Consultants and/or Expert within European tenders.

Use provided EU_CV_* 
styles to properly format the CV.

Indenting a paragraph automatically numbers/bullets it with the proper symbol and spacing.

Modify all placeholders (text in red)

This is a screenshot of how the first page of these CV look.
If you think it looks terrible: you are right, it IS terrible!

It looks like it was conceived to be printed on a dot matrix printer, doesn't it?
This is however the format in which you could be required to submit your CV, so brace yourself!
